# Email Analysis and Reporting System

## Overview

The Email Analysis and Reporting System is a Python-based application designed for cyber forensic investigations, specifically tailored to analyze `.eml` files. The system automates the extraction, analysis, and reporting of email metadata, content, and security attributes to facilitate comprehensive forensic examination and decision-making.

## Features

- **Email Metadata Extraction**: Parses `.eml` files to extract sender, recipient, subject, date, and 'Received' headers.
- **IP Address Analysis**: Identifies and geolocates IP addresses from 'Received' headers, visualizing email routing paths.
- **SPF Validation**: Verifies Sender Policy Framework (SPF) records for sender domains to enhance email authentication.
- **Content Extraction and Analysis**: Retrieves and analyzes textual content from emails for thorough investigation.
- **Reporting**: Generates HTML and PDF reports summarizing email analysis findings.
